# The Good Neighbor
## Overview
GoodNeighbor is a mobile application that attempts to create safer, more connected Hoboken and Stevens
communities by giving people the tools to be aware of what’s really happening around them.
Everyone deserves to feel safe, whether that be in their homes, schools, places of work, or
anywhere else that is vital to their quality of life. The app will also display alerts for missing pets, amber
alerts, severe weather events, and much more. The problem with current community apps is that they
are disorganized and full of misinformation. This app will improve the way people have access to
vital information that matters to them. Information will be organized into separate “communities” and categories
so that way users can subscribe to the content that is important to them. Additionally, during the
initial signup process, users will need to verify their identity and proof of address to be able to
enter a specific community.
